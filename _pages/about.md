I am a [Robotics Technologist](https://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/abhishek-cauligi/) with the Robotic Surface Mobility Group (347F) in the Robotics Section of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Prior to this, I was a member of the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/) at Stanford University, where I received my PhD. in Aeronautics & Astronautics.
