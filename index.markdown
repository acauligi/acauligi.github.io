Hi! I'm an [Assistant Professor](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/abhishek-cauligi/) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
My research focuses on developing safe and computationally efficient decision making algorithms for robotic systems.
In particular, I focus on studying how machine learning can be combined with model-based planning and optimal control techniques for applications in spacecraft and mobile robotic decision making.

Prior to this, I was a [Robotics Technologist](https://robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/abhishek-cauligi/) with the Robotic Surface Mobility Group (347F) at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and received my PhD. in Aeronautics & Astronautics at Stanford University as a member of the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/).
